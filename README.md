This program is designed and built for a recording data to a scientific
study. It allows the user to record collections of data from a variety of remote sites.

It's important to store your files in the following folder:

data/data/com.example.datacollection/files

You may have to create the folder, but often it is already there when the project builds.

The program runs best (in my experience) using a Nexus5 or Nexus5X emulator, some emulators seem to have
intermittent issues accessing that folder at times.
